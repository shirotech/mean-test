# MEAN Stack Developer Coding Challenge

The purpose of this coding challenge is to test a candidate's ability to
write concise, correct, elegant, robust and efficient code carrying the
duties of a *MEAN* (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js) Stack
Developer. Also to familiarise the tools and libraries we will be using.

## Technologies

- MongoDB 3.4.x
- Express.js 4.16.x
- AngularJS 1.6.x OR 5.0.x
- Node.js v8.x
- ES6
- Webpack

## Libraries

- [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) OR [mongodb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb) - MongoDB connector
- [bluebird](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluebird) - *Optional, provides a rich Promise API
- [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - *Optional, make HTTP calls easier
- Angular Material - *Optional, depending on Angular version of choice

## Testing

- [jasmine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine) - Unit Test
- [protractor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/protractor) - End-to-end Test

## Bonus

- Use of ES8 async/await
- Use of WebSocket using socket.io OR uWebSockets
- Mock responses based on environment development (for testing) vs production (from MongoDB)

## Task

- Develop a simple chat room that allows multiple people to join, data should persist
- Caching and optimisations will be a plus
- Making use of all the technologies at your disposal
- Leaving implementations open to interpretation as a test for making architectural decisions and why
- Back-end will have more weight than front-end, it doesn't have to look pretty, just correct usage of AngularJS will suffice
- This should take someone with 5+ years of experience around 3-5 hours.
